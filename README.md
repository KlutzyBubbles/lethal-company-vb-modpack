# lethal-company-vb-modpack
 
For the boys (and anyone else who believes in vb)

This modpack aims to keep a vanilla+ feel of the game with the idea of fun in mind.

## Versioning

To allow for a quick glance view on changes without looking at the change log the version (Major.Minor.Patch) will follow these rules

### Patch

Adding mods that are backwards compatible with other clients
Minor mod version changes that can be used with older clients

### Minor

Changes to mods that will likely cause unwanted behaviour if clients dont match (e.g. MoreCompany major updates which cause lobby issues)

### Major

Removal of mods (doesnt matter which ones). This is to indicate that the profile should be re made as updating a modpack does NOT remove mods
Changes to the game that will most likely crash due to old mods (links to removing mods above).
